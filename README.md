# TAFEL-PLOT-ANALYSIS
Corrosion Current and Potential value calculations from the Tafel plot of a material obtained from an Electrochemical Wet Corrosion Data.
Input the upper and lower bound for the cathodic and anodic potential ranges from the tafel region of the tafel plot for the accurate and precise intersection and I_corr and E_corr calculations.
Adjust the filter values and parameters accordingly with the SNR of the obtained test data.
